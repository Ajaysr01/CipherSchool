wild : pointers that are declared but not 
initialized since it contaion any value.

dangling: when we try to access a deleted/freed pointer, 
in such a case the pointer is called dangling.
it gives a default or garbage value. 
therefore pointers are assigned null value when they are deleted;

refrences cannot be null, its invalid. we need to assign a value to it;
also they cannot be reassigned, and if we try to it changes the value of the 
original variable to the new one, i.e reference stores the same memory location
but just change the value of it
